          The world around us is quite intriguing, I wish to explore and
          understand all of it! People are the most complex beings we know of,
          understaning the patterns of the masses would help my journey greatly.
          I have spent my time observing for far too long, now I wish to put my
          skills to the test and build new ones along the way. Wherever my path
          leads I will always follow one belief: Passion is Necessary, without
          passion there is no future. I will never stop chasing my passions
          because honestly, what other purpose is there?
          <br />
          I grew up in a poor household with no parental figures, creating the
          need to figure out the world for myself at an early age. Throughout
          school I explored many passions such as building robots for the
          Vibots, leading a mathlete team, and joining a chess club. In 2019 I
          graduated from Brandon High with Honors, testing the waters with
          college before quickly realizing it wasn't for me. I've always come up
          with ways to support myself without working at a conventional job. My
          favorite method was creating a service to help players improve in a
          video game I loved. Through this service I was able to travel across
          the country, have a ton of fun, and eventually move in with my
          partner! We now live in a beautiful small town in Massachussets and
          it's a dream come true.
          <br />
          Now that i'm settled in to a new home with my partner, it's time to
          continue with the next step of life: Turning a passion into a career.
          Analyzing stats and data has always been amazing, i'd love to do it
          for a living! Unfortunately staring at solely numbers all day wasn't
          for me, but fortunately Mehak opened my eyes to the world of Growth
          Marketing. In this field I can analyze data and hypothesize the best
          methods to improve results, sounds like a second dream come true!
